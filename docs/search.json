(Mandatory)\nIs there a README and does it document intended purpose? (Mandatory)\nIs the README clear and concise? (Optional - use analytics unit template or example)\nDo you need to consider MHRA ‘software as a medical device’ guidance? (Mandatory - use flowchart)\nWho has responsibility for ongoing support and communications for the code? (Optional Best practice to assign, else state the code is not maintained and when the last update was)\nHas a responsible disclosure process for security issues been defined? (Mandatory - could use github issues)\nWho will address identified issues and security concerns? (Mandatory. - assign monitoring of above disclosure process)\nHas semantic versioning been used? (Optional)\nHave contribution guidelines or PR style guides been included? (Optional)\nAre package dependencies and libaries documented with versions? (Optional)\nHas the code been linked to any published outputs so others can easily link to the code? (Optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the code include any sensitive, personal, secret or top secret data/information? (Mandatory)\nDoes the code include any unreleased policy? (Mandatory)\nDoes the code include business sensitive algorithms (e.g. finance allocations)? (Mandatory)\nHas written permission been obtained for any data stored from the data owner? (Mandatory)\nAre owners of services which the code fulfils aware of the release? (Mandatory)\nAre any data transfers conducted safely and securely? (Mandatory)\nAre any credentials contained in the source code? (Mandatory - check in both current version and git history)\nAre any secret keys contained in the source code? (Mandatory - check in both current version and git history)\nAre any SQL server addresses or connection strings in the source code? (Mandatory - check in both current version and git history)\nAre the commit messages informative? (Optional)\nDo the commit messages include any sensitive information (e.g. names)? (Mandatory)\nDoes the git history contain any sensitive information (e.g. at one time real data or credentials were in the code but have since been removed) (Mandatory)\nHave notebook outputs been removed/checked for sensitive information? (Mandatory - check but some appropriate outputs maybe useful: Example)\nIs configuration written as code and separated from analytical code? (Optional)\nhave you checked any screenshots or figures in your outputs and documentation for information that shouldn’t be released? (Mandatory)\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the code version controlled using GIT or similar? (Optional)\nIs the code stored in your organisational GitHub account? Is it the same organisation that funds the relevant staff time? (Optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nAre third party tools used within the code? (Mandatory check. Best practice is to keep an inventory)\nIf so do they adhere to the NCSC’s Cloud Security Principles? (Mandatory)\n\n\n\n\n\nHas a colleague reviewed the code for sensitive data content and security vulnerabilities? (Mandatory - Best practice is to record automated code quality and security tools used)\nHas a code quality review been completed focussing on the end usability and clarity? (Optional - consider runing through the example or similar code quality checklist)\nHas the code been assessed for its level or RAP(Reproducible Analytical Pipeline)? (Optional)\nHas the code undergone some level of testing.
